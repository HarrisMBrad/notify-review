                  <p>In APK file July 11, 2022 - The story feature took over 90 seconds to post. The user almost thought it would not work. And when it did, the user was only able or allowed to upload a video less than 15 seconds in time. So in the test on my first time uploading a story on any device, the experience was less than optimal or as performant as would be expected in compreable experiences in the fature in IG.</p>
